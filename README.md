# Namma Metro Ticketing System
 ## I have designed and developed a GUI-based Namma Metro Ticketing Machine system that helps users figure out the best routing and pricing options for any pair of boarding and destination points. The system streamlines the ticketing process and improves the user experience for commuters on the Namma Metro.
